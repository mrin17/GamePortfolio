JackKnife

Created in Unity

A unique twist on the traditional first person shooter, JackKnife provides elements of puzzle and strategy. When you shoot someone, you switch places with them. The enemies are AI in this game. Players cannot camp in JackKnife because if they shoot an opponent, they will be immediately brought out into the open where the opponent was. Conservation of ammo is also important in this game, and when you run out of bullets, you can melee attack your opponents. 

I worked on JackKnife in Unity with two other people in a group. I did the level building and the character movement. I also performed game analytics on the game. Basically, I had other people play the game and I tracked their decisions and movements with the tools from GameAnalytics.com. Some game elements that came out of this testing were the melee weapon, the difficulty of the opponent AI, the design of the levels, and more. This experience has proven to me that game analytics is a very interesting field of the gaming industry.

The hardest part of creating the game was getting the ray tracing to work. Both the player and the AI enemies used it, but we had to incorporate some randomness to the enemies' shooting. It was something none of us had done before, so we struggled. It was very satisfying when we got it to work.
