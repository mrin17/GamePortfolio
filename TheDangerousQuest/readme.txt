The Dangerous Quest

Created with c++ in Visual Studio 2010

The Dangerous Quest is a text based RPG that was programmed in C++ for a final project. In this game your character has to avenge your village's demise by defeating the Dark Lord. You must find your way through ten unique and challenging worlds. Featuring a turn based combat system, three different character classes, and many different randomly created choices and events per world. Level up and buy items and mercenaries to use on your quest. Challenge other players' teams in hot seat multiplayer. All lovers of ZORK and RPGs, especially when combined, would love The Dangerous Quest.

All of the dialogue had to be saved somewhere, so I created another file to hold it all, and just referenced it whenever I needed it. My favorite part of working on this game was getting the commands to work, as most of them could be easily tested. It guards against incorrect input, and also ignores capitalization. Also, I loved creating the different classes and their combat mechanics. The story was another aspect that I was eager to work on.
