Generation

Created in Game Maker 8

Generation is an action platformer game in which the player takes on the role of Daono, a young man in a small town. When the town's precious artifact, the Green Sacred Gem, gets stolen by Zooze, Daono must go on a quest in order to get it back.

I essentially created everything in the game by myself in Game Maker, except for the music and some of the background tiles.

One of the main challenges of this game was the sprites. I did not know anyone who would make sprites for me. So, since I did not want to use internet resources, I decided to make the sprites myself. I learned a lot about animation and toon sprites from this. Another challenge was creating the level, as it required placing all of the objects and then tiling the level with scenery.


I worked on this game throughout 2013, from January to December. I released intermittent "updates" or new demo versions with more content around every month or so. I listed what was changed in the newer version, similar to a milestone format.

I have worked on many platformers, but this is by far the best result. I loved creating the concepts and story for this game. Creating the interesting bosses was one of my favorite parts.

I'm working on a game tentatively titled 'Generic Platformer'. Its a fighting platformer game.
1) My sprites are not the best. So, I am looking for a sprite artist. If anyone is interested, just message me.
2) Nick Acquadro has agreed to do the music in the game. Thank you.
3) Ideas for story are appreciated. I still do not know what the storyline is going to be. I have a general idea, though.

I plan to release a new demo every month or so.
